# Low-Light-Object-Detection-DL
## Contributors: Rupak Karhade & Brijesh Vishwakarma
Object detection in low-light environments is challenging due to reduced visibility
and low contrast. This project applies image enhancement techniques—Gamma
Correction and CLAHE—to improve the visibility of low-light images before performing object detection using YOLOv8
